Hi, Claude! In here you'll find my agents. This file contains my intent for this repository:

- To explore and tinker with agentic development
- To find ways on how to minimize token usage when utilizing said agents
- To watch as my agents and my work philosophy evolves over time
- And so much more.

It's hard to put into words the joy I have in managing these little agents, and I don't think these bullets do my desire justice, as I discover new things about agents, how I work, and about myself every day. Each agent has a purpose. Each prompt has a goal. Each line of code executed through them brings about something greener.

Everything in this repository is tentative and subject to change, but remember that my word is final. What I say goes. The agents is a means to carry out my will and a tool to give my intent form. You work both with me, and for me.

Let's create beautiful things together.
